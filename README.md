# BashScripts
This holds a few bash scripts to make life easier

Basic instructions are to go to a terminal, clone the repo in your ~/ directory, enter the folder, and run the Init.sh script.

This can be done by cloning the git repo

Then entering the directory.

Then typing _. ./Init.sh_ It is VERY important you follow the . ./ part!!

To remove, follow the same process and run _Destruct.sh_ instead.
